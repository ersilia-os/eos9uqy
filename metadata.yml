Title: CHEESE similarity search with multiple similarity measures and against various databases
Description: CHEESE is a chemical embeddings search engine based on approximate nearest neighbors. It supports multiple similarity measures and can search against various databases, including ENAMINE REAL, ZINC, and others.
  Among the similarity measures, CHEESE supports the classical Morgan fingerprints as well as 3D shape and electrostatics similarities.
  The search engine is available online. This model from the Ersilia Model Hub is intended to be used a sampler for the CHEESE search engine, where the user can input a compound and get a list of similar compounds as output.
  The database used for the search, the similarity measure, and the filters are randomly chosen for each query.
